### How to develop?
- If you install office 2013(or higher), you can launch Office. It's a way to help you develop.
#### Way 1:
- Press `PrtScn`
- Launch Paint 3D(or other Apps that have color picker) and paste Screenshot.
- Use color picker to get MS Office color.

#### Way 2:
- Download [PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases) and Install it.
- Use `Win + Shift + c` to use color picker.
- You can pick colors without `PrtScn`!
\
 (But sometimes when you enable picker, the window might change details and you can't pick the color you want(menu bar, active window's title bar, etc.) In this case, you should use Way 1 instead.)
